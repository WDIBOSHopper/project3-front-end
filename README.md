# Project 3 Front End
Front End for General Assembly Project 3 

##Team Hopper
This app was created by @bbarbersox, @LaurenGrant, and @raq929

##Our App
We were assigned the content management system. We were Team Hopper, so we created Blog Hop, and app that lets you make blogs and pages quickly and easily. Visitors can see a list of posts by all users. Users can log in to go to a dashboard that allows them to create, edit, and delete posts on their blog page (determined by their username), and create pages that have a title and content. 

##Technologies
###Handlebars
We used Handlebars extensively in our front end to display our data. We used partials to make the dashboard, which was useful when we wanted to refresh the lists after create, edit, and delete. 

###MongoDB
We liked the flexibility of MongoDB. The ability to change schema easily was great. 

###Express.js / Node.js
We used Express and Node to power our back end. Express is a backend framework for node that helped us organize our app. We found making routes and controllers in node was more challenging than in Rails. The amount of freedom and complexity made express challenging. 

###Mongoose
We used mongoose to make querying the database easier. Also, having schema with validation was important to our project, which moongoose enabled us to do fairly easily. We also wanted to use it's populate method, but we found it difficult to implement and ultimately scrapped it. 

##Approach
We wanted to get started before the Thanksgiving break, but we hadn't finished all of the back end lessons. So we started with planning. Bill came up with some great user stories, which we pared down as a group and wrote acceptance criteria for. We then found some basic templates to match our wireframes, and set up a front end that used handlebars templates to fill in data. 

At the beginning of project week, we started on the back end. Because we were all new to Express and Node, we all worked together on the back end. We used ScreenHero to program together. 

Once the data schemas were setup, we performed extensive testing using mongoose crud, node script files & postman.  While this took a long time it was worthwhile, as once we moved onto integration with the front end we knew the issues were in the front end which saved us extensive time. 

We had no team integration issues - my squad mates were wonderful.  Communication was active, shared everything, lots of pair programming.  We all learned a great deal.

##Major hurdles
We had our login working at the beginning of the week, but it began working inconsistently mid-week, and was really difficult to debug. 

Testing could be difficult at the times.  The tools seem more rudimentry that those availablein ruby/rails.  Got better with the testing/debuggin as the week went on.  Once we got to the fromt end using the Chrome developer, which prove very useful.
